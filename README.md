- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeremyungx
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, software development and game development :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ / Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding better predictive models for both supervised and unsupervised learning, building efficient and effective software solutions using C++, Python, HTML/CSS/JS (and Kotlin ? learning atm), and making great games during my scarce free time :)
